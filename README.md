# e-doser

a modest vr experiment that builds on the ideas of i-doser, an application that uses binaural audio recordings to simulate moods and experiences--sometimes referred to as 'audio drugs'. with this app i wanted to simulate the professed effects of contemporary nootropics--to spark creativity, aid meditation, or provide comfort.  

aframe provided an easy way to integrate dynamic virtual environments with 360 deg sound and visuals. implementation of fully '3d' audio is still primitive and not supported on all devices.   

to use e-doser, simply focus your gaze on different mushrooms to explore new dimensions. move around each space to fully experience the spatialized sound environment.
